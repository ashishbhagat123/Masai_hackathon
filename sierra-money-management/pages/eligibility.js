        <strong>Documents Required For Personal Loan</strong>
        <p>
          Meeting the basic documentation requirement is a must for applying for
          any kind of loan. If you intend to apply for a personal loan , you
          must provide self-attested copies of all the required documents,
          depending upon a number of factors such as your service/profession,
          income and loan requirement. At the same time, carry the original
          copies for the purpose of verification.
        </p>
        <strong>What are the Interest Rates and the Tenure?</strong>
        <p>
          You can avail an attractive rate of interest on a personal loan, only
          after you have fulfilled the personal loan eligibility criteria.
          However, the rate of interest to be levied on your personal loan is
          solely at the bankâ€™s discretion. Currently, the rate of interest
          applied on personal loan varies from 10.75%-24% p.a. The tenure of a
          personal loan may range up to maximum 60 months.
        </p>
        <strong>Know Your EMIs and Available Repayment Options</strong>
        <p>
          If you take a personal loan you shall be offered with a convenient
          option of repaying your amount of loan over a period of fixed term.
          You can repay the borrowed sum through feasible EMIs which can be
          calculated accurately with the help of our Personal Loan EMI
          Calculator. The duration of the tenure and the monthly instalment of
          EMI are closely related to each other. The shorter the duration of the
          tenure higher will be the amount that you need to pay towards the
          repayment of the loan each month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure you check the personal loan eligibility criteria before
          applying for a personal loan.
